# 
# These instructions were made after succesfully installing MediaWiki on a CentOS7 server.  
#
# INSTRUCTIONS:
#
# 1. Obtain a fresh CentOS7 installation and login.
#
# Steps 2-6 will install the LAMP stack, with the required PHP 7.0 for this version of mediawiki
#
# 2. Install Git if you dont have it already with the below command:
#
# 		sudo yum -y install git
#
# 3. Copy this shell script with the below command:
#
# 		sudo git clone https://github.com/mitchellbryant/centos7-lamp
#
# 4. Change to the cloned directory
#
#		cd centos7-lamp
#
# 5. Make the script executable with the following command: 
#
#      chmod a+x centos7-lamp-setup.sh
#
# 6. Execute the script as a sudo user:
#
#      sudo ./centos7-lamp-setup.sh
#
# 7. Download MediaWiki 1.31 with curl and untar the package
#     
#		sudo curl -O https://releases.wikimedia.org/mediawiki/1.31/mediawiki-1.31.0.tar.gz
#
#		sudo tar xvzf mediawiki-1.31.0.tar.gz
#
# 8. Rename old html directory and rename mediawiki install directory to the /var/www/html directory
#
#		sudo mv html htmlold
#
#		sudo mv mediawiki-1.31.0 html
#
# 9. Restart Apache 
#
#		sudo systemctl restart httpd.service
#
# 10. Now you should be able to navigate to your server IP and you should be prompted to configure your LocalSettings.
#     Once you are done with configuration you will need to copy that LocalSettings.php file to your /var/www/html directory on the server.
#
#		Thats it!
